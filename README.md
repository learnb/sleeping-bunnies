# Sleeping Bunnies
A Pico-8 game made for [RNDGAME Jam 2020](https://itch.io/jam/rndgame-jam)

## Description
Stealth game. Player's goal is to keep the bunnies alive until maturity. Each bunny in the nest has a constantly depleting hunger meter than must be maintained. A bunny dies when its hunger meter is depleted. The player can refill a bunny's hunger meter by feeding it, which costs the mother energy. The player must collect food to maintain the mother rabbit's energy meter. The world the rabbit can explore is split into two types of areas: open fields and hidden trails.

You can find food sources in open fields but predators may also be watching. The rabbit can use the "sniff" ability to detect nearby predators. Predators can detect when the rabbit is nearby. When a predator detects the rabbit, it will have an alerted icon above it. If a predator is alert when the rabbit in an open field, it will chase it down. When chased by a predator, the rabbit will automatically use its "sprint" ability. This greatly increases the rabbit's speed but costs a lot of energy. Getting caught by a predator results in instant death for the rabbit.
